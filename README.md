## Tic Tac Toe Project Description

This game was built using ReactJS hooks like useState / useEffect and the 
minimax game theory algorithm. I learned a lot about ReactJS building this 
project and recommend any one else that wants to get better with ReactJS 
to take a crack at it

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
